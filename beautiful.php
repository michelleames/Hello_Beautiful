Plugin Name: Hello Quran

Description: Assalam Alaikum to you all, on 29 March 2021 I forked HelloBeautiful, a one PHP file plugin by Michelle Frechette who works for https://impress.org the guy behind GiveWP WordPress Donation and WP Business Reviews Plugins. <br>She has a very nice post worth reading here https://impress.org/how-hello-dolly-helped-me-appreciate-developers-even-more/ which got me into this whole thing of creating my own WordPress Plugin. Since PHP doesnâ€™t scare me <br>Like all Muslims around the world, we are constantly goingthrough a journey of self-discovery and personal improvement through theguidance of Allah's words.<br>This is not just a plugin, it's a comprehensive list of TheHoly Quran verses as quotes that teach us ways to improve our life.Guidance regarding every aspect of life. Remember Reading the Qur'an helps inrelieving stress and reducing anxiety and depression. <br>So, I hope this effort helps bring us closer to Allah andThe Holy Quran in the end Amen. When activated you will randomly see a quotefrom The Holy Quran, in the upper right of your admin screen on every page. <br>Read about me coding it on my bloghttps://ismailsirajeittembe.com/hello-quran-plugin/.
